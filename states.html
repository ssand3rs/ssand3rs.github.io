    <h1>State Websites</h1>
    
    <h2><a href="https://maine.gov"> 1. Maine</a></h2>
    <p>Maine's website is my favourite website due to how visually appealing it is to look when you first load the page. The menu navigation is also very slick and easy to navigate that contains helpful links to other sites that is related to Maine itself. It provides easy information about the government of Maine as well as its current govenor and how to contact them. The site loads information quickly with a nice sleek, modern design. </p>
    
    <h2><a href="https://maryland.gov"> 2. Maryland</a></h2>
    <p>Marylands website is well constructed website that provides easy access to various states needs. The menu, being located on the left side of the screen is easy to navigate and provides easy access to services needed by citizens with a nice, modern design wtih a video showcasing Maryland.</p>
    <h2><a href="https://arkansas.gov"> 3. Arkansas</a></h2>
    <p>Arkansas has a somewhat similar website to Maryland but the differences with these two is that Arkansas didn't split their home screen into links but instead expanded on it with slideshows and videos showcasing the community of Arkansas. While this website has some good features, they also have some lackig qualities such as their home screen being a bit too big and requires you to scroll throguh to find what you need (however, this could be intentional to get you to look at the pictures showcased.). Another issue is the site did take a while to load since it did have to load all the pictures, videos, and assests used to showcase the site but it isn't a huge issue.</p>
    <h2><a href="https://kansas.gov"> 4. Kansas</a></h2>
    <p>Kansas takes a basic approach to their website, especially compared to the others since their's isn't as flashy as the rest in terms of videos, slideshows, or many pictures showcasing the community. They do however have a much more organized website, especially in comparision to Arkansas, but the lack of "community feel" causes this to rank lower.  </p>
    
    <h2><a href="alaska.gov">5. Alaska</a></h2>
    <p>Alaska's website is a really bland and empty website with not much to show. In terms of images, we only have an Alaskan mountain range which is the only backgroud theme they use. While they do have menu's to organize what needs people may need, I find there is too many menu's since it causes it to feel convulated and crowded with all the different menu's put in place. The manu's as well aslo just look plain boring, there's no pop to them to bring in people to different sections of the website or have them feel excited about Alaska.</p>
