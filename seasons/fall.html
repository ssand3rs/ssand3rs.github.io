        <h2>Autumn baby</h2>
        <p>Fall, also know as Autumn is another one of Earth's seasons that is a transition season from Summer to Fall. Fall typically occurs from early to mid September and lasts to end of October or November. During Fall, day time starts to become shorter and the temperature slowly begins to drop in preperation for Winter. A core point in Fall is that many trees have their leaves change color into a orange-red color and shed these leaves off during the Fall months.</p>
