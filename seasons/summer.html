        <p>Summer time is here and it arrives as the hottest and brightest of the four seasons. Typically summer occurs from early to mid May or June and lasts to the end of July or end of August and occurs after Spring but is before Fall. During Summer, day time is longer and the nights become shorter but throughout summer the day time slowly decreases as the season progresses. </p>

        <p>While there isn't much folklore that associates summer with anything, human culture typically takes advantage of the Summer months by allowing holidays and breaks to occur so people may take advantage of the calm weather. Many people will typically look to take vacations and travel, while various schools/institutions will release people as well. Some activities that people may take advantage of include traveling, sports such as soccer, basketball, cricket, volleyball, water sports, and many more.</p>
