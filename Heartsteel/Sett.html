<p><img src="sett%20sign.jpg" alt="Sett" class="sett"> Don't let the chiseled abs fool you: With savvy style and a heart of gold tempered by years of hard work supporting his mom, Sett has earned his confident rapper's swagger. His last music career ended when he punched a paparazzo, but he won't be kept down. People call Sett a lot of things, but when he's on stage with HEARTSTEEL, you can call him “boss.”</p>
