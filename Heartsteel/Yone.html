<p><img src="yone%20sign.jpg" alt="Yone" class="yone"> Once a legendary DJ/producer, Yone grew disillusioned with the music industry and mysteriously dropped off the grid, leaving fans and critics alike wanting more. Meeting the other members of HEARTSTEEL pulled him out of his creative funk, and with his passion for music now reignited, Yone is determined to take this band straight to the top.</p>

        
<p>While he may not like the limelight, Yone couldn't help but dress for the band's chart-topping debut in a smart, sleek fit worthy of his sharp swordsmanship and even sharper style. It'd be a shame to hide behind a computer when you look this cool.</p>
