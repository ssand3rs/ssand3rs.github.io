        <header><a href="https://www.fandom.com">Fandom</a><p>Fandom is a terrible website and that is due to a multitude of reasons. First, the entire is absolutely littered with ads. It's almost impossible to navigate through the website with clicking or even seeing ads either popping up throughout your screen or multiple ads throughout the page. Second, the load times for the site and for any subsequent pages in the site are slower than normal. A part of this probably has to do with the script and how many pages are being linked to but also the ads on the website not only hinder the user expierence but also add an unneceray load to the website causing it to be slow. Third, the color and vibe of the website feels dull and uncreative. As soon as you open the page you are greeted with a colorful sunset-esque background but as soon as you scroll down and explore the rest of the page, that colorful background soon fades and is replaced by a bright, white background which removes much of the charm and creative focus that the start of the page had. </p>
        <p>While the site navigation is alright, the layout of the site feels cluttered with many of the sites topics being strewn throughout where they want you to be interested in what they have on here but it ends up being a bit of sensory overload with how much is displayed. Another issue with the layout is the lack of creativity with the various boxes and tables. Rather than be creative in how to design the boxes for their different topics such as giving different shapes or using diferent colors to add more visual flare, they instead kept the general, basic design of the tables/boxes rather than try to implement new style techniques for them.</p></header>
    
    <nav><a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/">League of Legends Wiki</a><p>The League of Legends wiki is a newly created site that grants users knowledge to the League of Legends game itself or to any information pertaing to its characters and in-game universe. This website is amazing for many reasons, One, the color and visual theme fit the feel and original theme of the game. While the constant blue background may be a turn off for many users, for others this color is a direct representation to the cool-headed nature of the game, reflecting how the wiki is a representation of the game by mirroring its color palette. Second, the wiki condenses any and all information relating to the Leaague of Legneds IP in a sleek, modern website design that grants easy access to this information. You can see this as you load into the page that there are multiple information boxes pertaing to League and either its in-game universe or any events happening in the real world. Third, the wiki had just moved off its original hosting platform, Fandom, and is now its own seperate domain which is backed by Riot Games, the company that created League of Legends meaning that not only is the site not littered with ads but also that all the information here is offically backed and sourced by the games creators.</p>
    <p>Returning back to the design of the site, the sleek, modern design of the site is accompanied by various fancy tiles that guide where you on where the information is. The background of the site also allows for these tiles to pop and help stick out on user navigation. The same applies to specific searches as well where the info displayed is neat, organized and helps the user find whatever desired information they were looking for.</p>    </nav>
    
    <section><a href="https://jojowiki.com">JoJo Wiki</a><p>The JoJo's Bizzare Encyclopedia (JoJo wiki) is a fan made, fan supported wiki that is centralized off the popular anime/manga series JoJo's Bizzare Adventure (JoJo or JJBA). This site aims to provide any and all knowledge relating to JoJo, whether that be information about in game characters or the universe or even about the creator of the series, Hirohiko Araki. This site is amazing due to 1. The easy user navigation when entering the page. Upon scrolling down through the page, users are easily able to access any information when scrolling to the navigation tab where it provides quick and easy access to any part of the wiki whether that be JoJo media, the JoJo world, or even how the series is printed and published. 2.

Sub-categories are also listed below which organizes the characters into their own respective factions, families, groups, etc. </p>
    <p>The site also contains some sections to it. The site provides you with a calendar of releases that occured during the series' lifetime, you are also given a quick, automoving infographic that recaps and tells about current/future events that will happen to the JoJo series as a way to keep fans informed.
